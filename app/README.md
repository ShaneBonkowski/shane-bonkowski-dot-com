## Next.js App

This directory is used to organize the main application files and components for the Next.js application. It follows specific naming conventions to maintain consistency and readability, ensuring that the codebase remains organized and easy to navigate.

### File Naming Conventions

Use kebab-case for page/app file names in the `app/` directory.

Example: `about-me.tsx`  
Incorrect: `AboutMe.tsx`, `about_me.tsx`

### Function Naming Conventions

Use camelCase for regular JavaScript or TypeScript functions, including API handler functions and utilities.

Example:

```js
function fetchUserData() { ... }
```
