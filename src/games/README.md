## Games Source Code

This directory contains the source code for games on the website, including the React Components, scenes, and specific styles for each game. The intent is to make each game as self-contained as possible within their directory.

## Game Template

There is an example of how to make a game in the `game-template` directory. Users should copy this template and use it as a framework to create their own games. The template provides a basic structure and necessary components to get started quickly.

### Running the game on a local development server

Run the following command to start the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Then, open a web browser and go to http://localhost:3000/games/game-template/ (or replace "game-template" with the name of your game).

NOTE: If you are building your own game, you will also need to create a page for it. See the `app/games/README.md` for more information.
