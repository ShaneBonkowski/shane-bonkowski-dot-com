Two distant cosmic archaeologists, armed with the goal of tracking the origins of man, find themselves in a long-forgotten corner of some long since forgotten galaxy.

How they ended up here was unclear, but the planet they sighted was scorched beyond recognition. It was a small, rocky planet orbiting a dim White Dwarf with just enough energy to glow, and nothing more. Cleary not a place hospitable for life, but maybe one day years and years ago it would have been ripe for life. Or so the faint biosignatures radiating off of it led them to believe. 

They almost decided against landing altogether. Time and time again, they had stopped to visit a rocky planet with faint biosignatures to no avail. But today was different. Maybe it was because it had been many millions of miles since their last expedition, and they were growing restless. Or perhaps it was some sort of cosmic intervention pointing them to this lonely planet. Regardless, they landed in what appeared to be a long-dried riverbed, evidenced by the long, branching channels resembling the rivers from their home planet. 

Just when they thought they had explored enough to conclude this was in fact just another lifeless rocky planet, one of them had spotted something strange off in the distance: a lonely vessel in surprisingly good shape. This was especially peculiar, considering that everything else in this godforsaken wasteland had been scorched beyond recognition. Its pure white frame stood out against the burnt black landscape like a star in an empty sky. Inside, they found a pristine skeleton clutching some sort of ancient recording mechanism. They pressed play.`,
