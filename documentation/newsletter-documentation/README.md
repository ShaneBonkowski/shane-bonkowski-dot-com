# Newsletter / RSS Feed Documentation

This project uses an RSS feed to provide a lightweight newsletter mechanism for the website. It allows users to subscribe to updates for new posts, comics, and other content without the overhead of a traditional email newsletter.

## How It Works

1. **Script Location**  
   The RSS feed is generated by the script located at: `src/scripts/generate-rss.ts`.

2. **Automatic Generation**
   The script is automatically called after every build via the postbuild script in `package.json`.

3. **Output**
   The script generates the RSS XML file and writes it to: `public/feed.xml`. This file is then available to be served as the canonical RSS feed for the site.

## What an RSS Feed Is

RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is an XML-based format for publishing regularly updated content. Feed readers and RSS watchers can monitor the feed for updates and display them to subscribers.

## Why Use an RSS Feed

An RSS feed is used instead of a traditional newsletter because:

- Setting up a proper newsletter often requires extra requirements like a business address, compliance, and management overhead.
- RSS allows users to subscribe easily using an RSS feed watcher, without all the extra steps.
- When the RSS feed updates (new posts, comics, etc.), the feed watcher detects the change and sends an email to subscribers automatically.

Users can subscribe to the feed [here](https://follow.it/shane-s-games?leanpub), which links to the [Follow.it](https://follow.it/) RSS feed notifier service. More advanced users could also use any other RSS subscription tool by providing the following link to the RSS feed: https://shanebonkowski.com/feed.xml.

This setup is simple, reliable, and keeps the content subscription-friendly without additional compliance overhead.

In order to verify that I am the owner of this site to `Follow/it`, I needed to add the `verification-follow_it-FuM824HaauE8Nq9z8C75.html` file to `/public`.

## Adding new data types

In the future, if there is ever new data types outside of `content-box-data.ts` and `comic-data.ts`, there will likely need to be updates to `src/scripts/generate-rss.ts` so that the rss feed still gets automatically updated when new content is created.

## Developer Notes

To generate the RSS feed locally without rebuilding the whole site:

```bash
npm run postbuild
```

This will update `public/feed.xml` so you can preview the feed.
