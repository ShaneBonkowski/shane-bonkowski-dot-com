## Type Definitions

This directory is used to store TypeScript type definitions and interfaces.

In TypeScript, a type is a way to define the shape and structure of data. Types provide a way to describe the expected properties and methods of an object, the types of values that variables can hold, and the signatures of functions. By using types, TypeScript helps catch errors at compile time, improving code quality and maintainability.
